## 🔎 Project Overview

This project builds a machine-learning based model to **predict depression risk/level among students** using a structured dataset (academic, demographic and lifestyle features). The goal is to provide a tool that can help identify students potentially at risk, enabling early support or intervention.

## ⚙️ What’s Inside

- `student_depression_dataset.csv` — The dataset used for training and evaluation.  
- `basic_student_depression_model.pkl` — A baseline ML model (trained on the dataset).  
- `AdaBoost_model.pkl` — A trained ML model (e.g. using AdaBoost) for depression prediction.  
- `app.py` — A simple application/interface to use the model for prediction (e.g. take user input, output prediction).  
- `banner.png` — (optional) banner or logo for UI / documentation.
